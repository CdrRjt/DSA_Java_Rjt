                  TIME COMPLEXITY

 Q What is time complexity?
 -> Time complexity is not equal t0 the time taken.
    Time complexity is the mathematical function that tells us how the time will grow as the input grows

 Q What do we need to consider when thinking about complexity?
 ->  1 : Always look for worst case complexity while designing your algorithm.
     2 : Always look at complexity for large data.
     3 : We don't care about the actual time taken, since it different from machine to machine, what we only care is how is time
         actually growing as the input is growing. We don't need the correct time we just need a relationship,this is why we ignore
         constants.
     4 :  Ignore the less dominating terms

   NOTATIONS

   1 : Big - Oh - notation

       (n3) -> It is the upper bound , the complexity of the algorithm will not  exceed n3.

   2 : Big - omega - notation

       (n3) -> It is the lower bound or the algorithm will take atleast this many steps.It could be more
               the least is n3.

   3 : Theta notation

       (n3) -> It is when the both upper bound and lower bound is equal to n3.

       LITTLE NOTATIONS

   4 : Little - oh - notation

       It means strictly upper bound. refer to the copy.

   5 : Little - omega - notation

       It means strictly lower bound.


       SPACE COMPLEXITY

   Auxiliary space -> Extra space taken by the algorithm.

   Space Complexity -> Auxiliary space + the size of the input.And we always talk about auxiliary space.
